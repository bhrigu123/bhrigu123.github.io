        <h4>Friday, July 19 2019, almost midnight - some roon in Shanghai</h4>

<p>There I was. Standing in a room, with my backpack on, next to my friend Rohan. There were a bunch of people talking in foreign language among themselves. A middle-aged woman, a guy with earpods on, a little girl, a guy holding a broom, and a guy lying in a relaxed position in the lower bunker bed on the left corner of the room. That relaxed was actually not talking. Just a mere observer. Looked like the guy with the broom had been doing some cleaning (obviously). He was standing next to a rubble of bricks, cement and ceramic of what looked like a fallen wall. That scene wasn&rsquo;t quite obvious. And I thought, how in the world did I end up here, and what in the world is happening. Stranded in a city with no contacts or place to stay and it was alomost midnight in this scary environment. I mean I wasn&rsquo;t that scared&hellip;&hellip;..well maybe just a little.</p>

<h4>Few hours earlier - Ocean International Center, Beijing</h4>

<p>It was almost 5PM and I was just finishing up a piece of Typescript code for my React application in the office. &ldquo;Alright it&rsquo;s time to leave. Our bullet train leaves at 7&rdquo;, Rohan reminded from his adjacent desk.</p>

<p><strong>The bullet train</strong><br/>
Now we were travelling at the speed of more than 450kmph towards what seemed like an exciting destination. We had gotten some help from our friends in the office in booking the round trip tickets to Shanghai. It&rsquo;s a 4 hour journey from Beijing to Shanghai via the train. We would reach Shanghai Friday night and we would have the whole day of Saturday to roam around the city (we had the return train at Saturday late evening only).</p>

<p>Since we would just need to sleep through one night only, Rohan had booked a room at a hostel near to the train station which was quite cheap. Payment was to be done at the time of check-in. We&rsquo;ll reach late night, walk to the hostel, do check-in, have a good night&rsquo;s sleep, wake up early, and head out to city. Sounded like a good plan. Simple and easy&hellip;&hellip;.or, was it?</p>

<h4>10PM - Shanghai railway station</h4>

<p>Now we were outside the Shanghai railway station. We were using a taxi mobile app to navigate towards our hostel location. Along the railway stations we saw people sleeping and lying around the floors using carpets and blankets. We thought, &lsquo;not much different from India looks like&rsquo;.</p>

<p>It was around 20 minute walk towards the destination. Everwhere it was quite dark and deserted. Occasionally we would see one or two people passing us. We passed a McDonalds, an underpass, closed markets, empty roads and finally reached the location. All we saw was closed shops in the buildings around us. We strolled for a bit and went around the line of shops and saw a gated residence community. Nothing around us looked like a hostel and we had to assume that our hostel should be inside the community only.</p>

<h4>The man in the shorts</h4>

<p>We approached the security guard sitting in his cabin just outside the main gates. At first we tried simple English words like &lsquo;hostel&rsquo;, &lsquo;stay&rsquo; and &lsquo;booking&rsquo;, but we figured it wasn&rsquo;t working. We used the translator mobile app to let him know what we were trying to say and also showed our booking confirmation. But the guard wouldn&rsquo;t take any of it. He wouldn&rsquo;t allow us to enter the community. He kept making a telephone signal using his hand. We figured he wanted someone residing in the community flats to call him via intercom to let us enter. Well, we didn&rsquo;t get any contact number from our hostel reservation. There was no one we knew or could contact.</p>

<p>Well, that was it. We were standing outside the gates. It was late night and we had no place to stay and no one to contact. You might think what&rsquo;s the big deal. Try booking another place. There should be numerous hotels we could look up. Well, that might have been easier if we were in another country. Here, no one among the common folks speak English. Along with that there are no mobile apps in English which we could&rsquo;ve used. Even the Maps were not in English and we had to somehow make up with using the Taxi app for navigation.</p>

<p>Just then, we heard a voice of a man from behind.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;o hey! Yhu guys lookin fo' hostel? Follo me!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>We turned. It was a stout man, in a vest, shorts and flip-flops, walking steadily towards us.</p>

<h3>Follow the vest guy</h3>

<p>Next thing we knew we were following that person. We were walking along the perimeter of the residence outside its boundaries. He was walking ten steps ahead of us. There was also a second man walking along with the him and looked like was also guided by the vest guy. (Vest guy - I don&rsquo;t know what else to call him)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true we <em>were</em> a little anxious, no doubt. But it&rsquo;s not like we had much options. &ldquo;Oh great, just imagine getting looted in Shangai&rdquo; - Rohan joked. I laughed but at the same time I was like <em>&lsquo;What the hell, dude!&rsquo;</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;yhu guys students, right?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The vest guy called out. Neither of us responded not knowing what to say, and probably thinking the other one would respond. We kept on walking.</p>

<p>We arrived at what looked like a back entry of the residence. It was dark, unguarded and what seemed like an unofficial entry inside. We walked and were officially inside the community ()</p>
