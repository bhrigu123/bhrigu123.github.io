Below is a short story about a time me and a friend went to Shanghai. It was a long, suspenseful, and apprehensive night.

# Chapters



#### Midnight, 12:30 AM - some room in Shanghai  
There I was. Standing in a room, with my backpack on, next to my friend Rohan. There were a bunch of people talking in foreign language among themselves. A middle-aged woman, a man with earpods on, a little girl, and a man holding a broom. There was also another guy lying in a relaxed position in the lower bunker bed on the left corner of the room. That relaxed guy was actually not talking. Just a mere observer. Looked like the guy with the broom had been doing some cleaning (obviously). He was standing next to a rubble of bricks, cement and ceramic of what looked like a fallen wall. That scene wasn't quite obvious. And I thought, how in the world did I end up here, and what in the world is happening. Stranded in a city with no contacts or place to stay and it was alomost midnight in this scary environment. I mean I wasn't that scared........well maybe just a little.


#### Few hours earlier - Friday, July 19 2019 - Ocean International Center, Beijing
It was almost 5PM and I was just finishing up a piece of Typescript code for my React application in the office. "Alright it's time to leave. Our bullet train leaves at 7", Rohan reminded from his adjacent desk. 

### The bullet train
Now we were travelling at the speed of more than 450kmph towards what seemed like an exciting destination. We had gotten some help from our friends in the office in booking the round trip tickets to Shanghai. It's a 4 hour journey from Beijing to Shanghai via the train. We would reach Shanghai Friday night and we would have the whole Saturday to roam around the city (we had the return train at late Saturday evening only). 

Since we would just need to sleep through one night only, Rohan had booked a room at a hostel near to the train station which was quite cheap. Payment was to be done at the time of check-in. We'll reach late night, walk to the hostel, do check-in, have a good night's sleep, wake up early, and head out to city. Sounded like a good plan. Simple and easy.......or, was it?

### 10PM - Shanghai railway station
Now we were outside the Shanghai railway station. We were using a taxi mobile app to navigate towards our hostel location. Along the railway stations we saw people sleeping and lying around the floors using carpets and blankets. We joked, 'not much different from India looks like'.

It was around 20 minute walk towards the destination. Everwhere it was dark and deserted, except for the street lights. Occasionally we would see one or two people passing us. We passed a McDonalds, an underpass, closed markets, empty roads and finally reached the location. All we saw were closed shops in the buildings around us. We strolled for a bit and went around the line of shops and saw a gated residence community. Nothing around us looked like a hostel and we had to assume that our hostel should be inside the community only.

#### The man in the shorts
We approached the security guard sitting in his cabin just outside the main gates. At first we tried simple English words like 'hostel', 'stay' and 'booking', but we figured it wasn't working. We used the translator mobile app to let him know what we were trying to say. We also showed our booking confirmation. But the guard wouldn't take any of it. He wouldn't allow us to enter the community. He kept making a telephone hand signal. We figured he wanted someone residing in the community flats to call him via intercom to let us enter. Well, we didn't get any contact number from our hostel reservation. There was no one we knew or could contact. We just had the block and room number of our booking. We tried to talk and convince the guard for a very long time, but he just wouldn't allow it.

Well, that was it. We were standing outside the gates. It was late night and we had no place to stay and no one to contact. You might think what's the big deal. Could've tried booking another place. There should be numerous hotels we could look up. Well, that might have been easier if we were in another country. Here, no one among the common folks spoke English. Along with that there are no mobile apps in English which we could've used. Even the Maps were not in English and we had to somehow make up with the Taxi app for navigation.

Just then, we heard a voice of a man from behind. 

>"o hey! Yhu guys lookin fo' hostel? Follo me!"

We turned. It was a stout man, in a vest, shorts and flip-flops, walking steadily towards us. 


### Following the vest guy
Next thing we knew we were following that person. We were walking along the perimeter of the residence outside its boundaries. He was walking ten steps ahead of us. There was also a second man walking along with the him and looked like was also guided by the vest guy.

It's true we *were* a little anxious, no doubt. But it's not like we had much options. "Oh great, just imagine getting looted in Shangai" - Rohan joked. I laughed, but on the inside I was like *'What the hell, dude!'*.

>"yhu guys students, right?"

The vest guy called out. Neither of us responded not knowing what to say, and probably thinking the other one would respond. We kept on walking.

We arrived at what looked like a back entry of the residence. It was dark, narrow and unguarded, and what seemed like an unofficial entry inside. We went right through it and were now officially inside the community.

There were multiple blocks of buildings inside the community. Ours was supposed to be block 8. We thought of going our own way towards our block but the vest guy kept calling us towards towards a different block. We tried to tell but he insisted on coming to that block only. Was the hostel reception in this block or something? We didn't know. We reluctantly followed him at first. He opened the block's door with an electronic key and called an elevator. THe vest guy and the other person he was with entered the elevator, holding the door for us. Rohan and I discussed a bit and thought better than following that guy. Vest guy continued to call us in but we told him we would find our way. He seemed to get really frustated and just snapped - *"If yhu don't want to come don't come don't waste my time"*. The elevator closed. ROhan and I made our way out, dodging some furniture which was being shifted into that block. We were back outside the building.

### The airpods guy
It would've been around 11:30 PM by now. We thought of simply going directly to our room which we had booked. We strolled for a bit but couldn't find block 8. We stopped a man moving past us who was wearing a backpack and had his airpods on, and asked for our block. He didn't understand English, so we showed the translation in our mobile. He read and signalled us which meant only one thing - *Follow me*.

So we were following the air pods guy now. He led us to our block and we found the entry gate of the block to be locked. The airpods guy tried his hands at it but it didn't work. He took out his phone, made a call, and within few seconds the door clicked open. Me and Rohan went inside and thanked the airpods guy. But he was also entering the same block and we all entered the elevator. Probably he also lived here only, we thought. Ours was room 802, and we pressed the 8th floor button. The airpods guy did not press any floor button. Probably, he lived on the 8th floor too...? I mean what are the chances? We waited as the elevator reached 8th floor, and the door opened. But we didn't get out.


### The little girl
Just as the elevator opened at the 8th floor, we were stopped short by the presence of a little girl right outside the elevator. As if waiting for us. She could've been 10-11 years old. She and the airpods guy started talking in Chinese. Probably talking about us only. Me and Rohan couldn't get hold of what was happening, and started to head out. But the airpods guy stopped us and tried to tell us something. He wanted us to get back in the elevator as we were in the wrong floor. We tried to explain, but he kept on pointing to the 9th floor button. Was the hostel reception in 9th floor only? We didn't know anything ofcourse and finally gave in to going with him to 9th floor.

So all of us, including the little girl, went one more floor up. They took us to an apartment and without even knocking, opened the door. It seemed like a regular apartment except for all the rubble and cement debris lying on the right corner. Next to it was a guy holding a broom.


### The mysterious room
We all walked inside. The aripods guy and the broom guy started talking in Chinese. As always, me and Rohan just stood there not knowing what to do. It was already past midnight. I tried to take a moment to understand what was happening but none of it was making sense. Do these guys know each other? Why was there so much debris on the floor? There was a also bunker bed on the left corner of the room. On its lower bed, there was one more person there relaxing. He was just observing us. What was the deal with that guy?

Just then the little girl must've thought of leaving and just dashed out of the room, slamming the door shut. My heart skipped a beat. Was the door locked now? Were we trapped? I stood there for a while and talked Rohan into getting out of here right now. Just wanting to get out of that place isntantly, we just started walking towards the door saying *'we'll just find our way'*, not letting them talk us into things more. Gladly the door was unlocked, and we just stepped out and closed the door behind us.


### The middle-aged woman
We had just headed straight out of that room as quickly as possible, and closed the door. There was a sigh of relief. At least we were not trapped or confined. We were free mein again.  
Not sure what room
