`django-admin.py startproject newproj`<br>
I had learnt the django framework basics quite a while ago, but never worked on or made a complete functional project.<br>
To kick off, I'm starting a basic Q&A app using django, and plan to learn along with the challenges I face, and discover new stuff.<!--more-->

Now, I don't know much about other frameworks available, but I believe that django provides the best technique to handle the databases required and makes complicated db design a piece of cake. However, it is also important to understand how they work at the SQL level, to better understand what we are doing. <br>
Moreover, programming in python makes our code clean and formatted, allows easy debugging and modifications.

For me, I only like handling the backends of a website, while the templates or webpage/layout designing is not really my cup of tea.<br>

		That's right. Made a rough ER diagram also ;)

So I hope this would be a good start, and I plan to create some more stuff and apps in the future that could be useful to people in some way.
