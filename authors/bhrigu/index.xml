      <description>Back in 2015 I kicked off blogging when I discovered Octpress. It has been a great journey in my writing experience. I had started it to mostly comprise of technical articles. But over the time it evolved to be a collection of articles around productivity, projects and my life&amp;rsquo;s events as well (a journal of sorts), besides just the tech articles that I write.
What gives me high is the tremendous response I get on my website.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first step in &lt;strong&gt;time management&lt;/strong&gt; is to assess yourself. Meaning, track how and where you spend your time. I was reading one of Harvard Business Review&amp;rsquo;s publication called &lt;strong&gt;Managing Time&lt;/strong&gt;, which walks us through the tips for good time management.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the March of 2020 now. I am super late this time to write about my last year in review blog post. The thing is, 2020 has been a super confusing ride from the beginning. And it&amp;rsquo;s just March. Anyways, more about 2020 next year. I&amp;rsquo;ll just take out some time now to write about 2019 while I am in Delhi for the Holi holidays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, 2018 is over and it feels like it went by so fast. As compared to 2017 or &amp;lsquo;16, there might not be anything that was majorly interesting, but nonetheless, it was a good year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh, hey! Don&amp;rsquo;t mind, this is just a test blog. I don&amp;rsquo;t really have anything on my mind on what to put down on this one. I overslept the last night, had some relaxing nap some time later, and here I am super awake at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love listening to music on Spotify. There were times I used to wish that I could instantly view lyrics of the song being played on Spotify, without going through the trouble of browsing the net. Well, not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Game of Thrones&amp;rdquo; is almost on every lips of the people you come across. You yourself might be an ardent follower of the hit HBO TV series. But what you might not be aware of is the genius put behind in building up this epic fantasy series, by none other than the author himself of A song of ice and fire books: George RR Martin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are several tools &amp;amp; libraries to edit audio/video files in Linux, such as change dimensions, video converter, resize/rotate images etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainly we&amp;rsquo;ll use &lt;code&gt;avconv&lt;/code&gt;, which can be used as command line in &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;The site&#39;s live.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a lot of work and testing to finally launch the beta version of &lt;a href=&#34;#&#34;&gt;JEEQuery&lt;/a&gt;. It is something I have been working on for a long time, which brought forward various challenges and hurdles, and kept me occupied all this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;To kick off, I&amp;rsquo;m starting a basic Q&amp;amp;A app using django, and plan to learn along with the challenges I face, and discover new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
