Before I leave for Hyderabad in a few days, I thought of paying another visit to Lodhi Garden, and immerse myself into its serene environment one last time (before I return).

I usually do not carry my cell phone whenever I go out for a walk, but this time I thought of capturing some moments and, well, share on my blog.


I take the road along my colony to cover up 1.5 KMs to reach the garden.

The trees will greet you along the path at the entrance of the garden.

Well, that's all folks!

Until next time.
