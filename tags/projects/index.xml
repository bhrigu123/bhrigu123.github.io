      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love listening to music on Spotify. There were times I used to wish that I could instantly view lyrics of the song being played on Spotify, without going through the trouble of browsing the net. Well, not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was the summer of 2015. I was down with an illness and had to stay confined in a room. Being too disinclined to prepare for interviews, I started out with a new django project, with the purpose of learning some new stuff in django.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;The site&#39;s live.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a lot of work and testing to finally launch the beta version of &lt;a href=&#34;#&#34;&gt;JEEQuery&lt;/a&gt;. It is something I have been working on for a long time, which brought forward various challenges and hurdles, and kept me occupied all this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;django-admin.py startproject newproj&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had learnt the django framework basics quite a while ago, but never worked on or made a complete functional project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To kick off, I&amp;rsquo;m starting a basic Q&amp;amp;A app using django, and plan to learn along with the challenges I face, and discover new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
