      <description>Looking back at 2020, it was a confusing ride. The pandemic / lockdown had nothing to with that, for me at least. For me it was&amp;hellip;.really&amp;hellip;confusing, at a personal level. Not sure what other word to use to describe it.
It had started off well, in January. But Feb / March onwards was when it started to get&amp;hellip;confusing.
Anyways, leaving that confusion apart, due to the lockdown I really got to try out things I didn&amp;rsquo;t take out time to do earlier.</description>

      <description>Back in 2015 I kicked off blogging when I discovered Octpress. It has been a great journey in my writing experience. I had started it to mostly comprise of technical articles. But over the time it evolved to be a collection of articles around productivity, projects and my life&amp;rsquo;s events as well (a journal of sorts), besides just the tech articles that I write.
What gives me high is the tremendous response I get on my website.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first step in &lt;strong&gt;time management&lt;/strong&gt; is to assess yourself. Meaning, track how and where you spend your time. I was reading one of Harvard Business Review&amp;rsquo;s publication called &lt;strong&gt;Managing Time&lt;/strong&gt;, which walks us through the tips for good time management.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the March of 2020 now. I am super late this time to write about my last year in review blog post. The thing is, 2020 has been a super confusing ride from the beginning. And it&amp;rsquo;s just March. Anyways, more about 2020 next year. I&amp;rsquo;ll just take out some time now to write about 2019 while I am in Delhi for the Holi holidays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
