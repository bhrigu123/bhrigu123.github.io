    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><code>The site's live.</code></p>

<p>It took a lot of work and testing to finally launch the beta version of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jeequery">JEEQuery</a>. It is something I have been working on for a long time, which brought forward various challenges and hurdles, and kept me occupied all this time.</p>

<!--more -->


<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jeequery">JEEQuery</a> is actually a Q&amp;A app for students preparing for various engineering entrance examinations. Students can post Questions, providing description and use <em>tags</em>,  and get suitable answers from other fellow students.<br> The site offers easy to reach facilities and fundamental features such as upvoting, sharing, adding to favourites etc. The site mainly focuses on JEE preparation and provides various pre-defined tags, that are related to JEE, that could be used.</p>

<p>It was not a smooth journey after all, and took significant amount of hours, head scratching, brain teasing and was done amid some misfortunes, internship interviews, college etc. <br>
Although I handled the backends of the website, I got notable aid from my bother Yask ( <a href="http://github.com/yask123">@yask123</a> ) in it and significantly in the front end and designing. Also, Yask took over the deployment work efficiently, where we used Amazon Web Services and created a linux box instance running Ubuntu 14.04 with gunicorn and nginx server. Using AWS was something new for us, and created several obstructions, which were overcome and also taught us many things.</p>

<h3>Name and Graphics</h3>

<p>After several reviews, we settled for the name <em>JEEQuery</em>, which is short and handy, and also sounds similar to jquery ;)</p>

<p>The logo of our idea is a glowing <em>bulb</em>. Now a bulb actually symbolizes fundamental innovation and ideolog&hellip;.OK wait&hellip;who am I kidding. I don&rsquo;t know what it symbolizes. We just found it on ClipArt and it nicely replaces the &lsquo;Q&rsquo; in our title.</p>

<p>Here is the snapshot of About page:</p>

    <id>http://bhrigu123.github.io//blog/2015/07/06/starting-django-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><code>django-admin.py startproject newproj</code><br>
I had learnt the django framework basics quite a while ago, but never worked on or made a complete functional project.<br>
To kick off, I&rsquo;m starting a basic Q&amp;A app using django, and plan to learn along with the challenges I face, and discover new stuff.<!--more--></p>

<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know much about other frameworks available, but I believe that django provides the best technique to handle the databases required and makes complicated db design a piece of cake. However, it is also important to understand how they work at the SQL level, to better understand what we are doing. <br>
Moreover, programming in python makes our code clean and formatted, allows easy debugging and modifications.</p>

<p>For me, I only like handling the backends of a website, while the templates or webpage/layout designing is not really my cup of tea.<br></p>

    <img class="[erimg]" src="http://bhrigu123.github.io//images/startdjango/er.jpg" width="500"><br>
    <small>
        That's right. Made a rough ER diagram also ;)
    </small> 
</center>


<p><br></p>

<p>So I hope this would be a good start, and I plan to create some more stuff and apps in the future that could be useful to people in some way.</p>

    <link href="http://bhrigu123.github.io//blog/2015/06/22/how-to-install-ubuntu-with-dual-boot-easy-step-wise-guide/"/>

    <id>http://bhrigu123.github.io//blog/2015/06/22/how-to-install-ubuntu-with-dual-boot-easy-step-wise-guide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is the easy step-wise installation guide to install Ubuntu along side with your Windows (dual boot)</p>

<h4>Step 1: Make sure you have free, unallocated space</h4>

<p>Open your Windows, right click on your &lsquo;Computer&rsquo;, click on &lsquo;Manage&rsquo;, Click on &lsquo;Disk Management&rsquo; <br>
Here you shall see the current partitions of hard disk.<!--more--> <strong>Your computer allows at max of 4 primary partitions only.</strong> So make sure that you have no more than 2 partitions (as Windiows creates a reserved partition known as &lsquo;System Reserved&rsquo;, and we will install Ubuntu in the fourth one). <br>
In case you have 3 or more partitions, transfer all files from one partition to another and delete that partition. For eg. , Transfer all files from your E:// Drive to D:// drive, and in the &lsquo;Disk Management&rsquo;, right click on the partition corresponding to E:// drive and delete that partition. (such that you only have C:// and D:// drive in your <em>Computer</em> (and you will also see <em>System Reserved</em> in Disk Managament. So total 3 primary partitions))</p>

<p><em>[<code>Note:</code> If you have any important files on your PC, you must always back up your data in the proper drive or on another device /drive is possible. You are responsible for any changes being made on the computer, and always read the instructions carefully]</em></p>

<p><img class="[diskimg]" src="http://bhrigu123.github.io//images/ubuntu/diskmgmt.jpg" width="600">
<br>
The removed space is shown in black as &lsquo;Unallocated Space&rsquo;, where we&rsquo;ll install Ubuntu. <br>
(You can also shrink other volumes to create unallocated space, as required. I recommend at least 60 gb of space for Ubuntu, depending upon the type of work you will be doing.)</p>

<h4>Step 2: Download Ubuntu and make a bootable device</h4>

<p>Download the latest version of Ubuntu from <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">here</a>
<br>
Now, a bootable pen drive is to be made using the downloaded .iso file. Download the software <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/">Universal USB Installer</a>, and follow its instructions to do so. <br>
(Or you can also use <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/">Rufus</a>)</p>

<h4>Step 3: Boot the pen drive</h4>

<p>Restart your computer and press the Boot Menu Key, to open boot options when the display starts. (Usually it&rsquo;s F12 key) <br>
Select the Pen Drive to boot from it.<br>
When Ubuntu loads, select the option &lsquo;Install Ubuntu&rsquo; and follow the instructions.
Connect to the internet if possibe, and <em>check</em> on &lsquo;Install Updates while installing&rsquo; and &lsquo;Install Third Party Software&rsquo;</p>

<h4>Step 4: Creating Partitions for Ubuntu</h4>

<p>When it asks for the type of installation, select &lsquo;Something else&rsquo;.
<img class="[diskimg]" src="http://bhrigu123.github.io//images/ubuntu/somethingelse.png" width="600" height="800" title="[Select 'Something else' [Installation type]]" ></p>

<p>Now you would see the partitions of your disk as: <br>
<img class="[diskimg]" src="http://bhrigu123.github.io//images/ubuntu/partitions.jpeg" width="500" height="500" title="[[partitions]]" > <br>
In this image, sda1, sda2 and sda4 are the current partitions of the disk, and <strong>free space</strong> is the unallocated space. <br>
(If you see <em>unusable space</em> instead of <em>free space</em>, that means your computer already has 4 primary partitions, and you will need to delete one of the partition. Partition could be deleted from here also by selecting that partition and clicking on the minus &lsquo;-&rsquo; sign below (but data in that drive will be lost. Therefore, open windows, back up your data, and delete partition from there) )</p>

<p>Select the <em>free space</em>, click on &lsquo;+&rsquo; to create a partition for the root folder as: <br>
<img class="[diskimg]" src="http://bhrigu123.github.io//images/ubuntu/createpart.png" width="500"> <br>
Here, 20gb is being allocated for your workspace in Ubuntu. I recommend around 50-100 GB (depending on the work you will be doing.)</p>

<p>Select <em>free space</em> and Click on &lsquo;+&rsquo; again to create &lsquo;Swap Area&rsquo; as: <br>
<em>If you have less than 4GB of RAM, select the size of swap area equal to your RAM, else select 4GB. Since I have 4GB RAM, I&rsquo;ll select 4096 MB for Swap Area</em> <br>
<img class="[diskimg]" src="http://bhrigu123.github.io//images/ubuntu/swaparea.jpeg" width="500"> <br></p>

<p>Create another partition for &lsquo;Boot&rsquo; of 512 MB as:
<img class="[diskimg]" src="http://bhrigu123.github.io//images/ubuntu/newboot.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>Now you have successfully created your partitions. The root directory <em>&lsquo;/&rsquo;</em> is where Ubuntu will be installed, and where you will save your files. Proceed and Confirm <em>&lsquo;Write Changes to Disk&rsquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Follow rest of the instructions to fill up your basic details, and continue with the installation. You will see the installation bar which takes a few minutes, and later will ask you to restart your computer.</p>

<h4>Step 5: Installation Complete</h4>

<p>When installation completes and the computer restarts, you will be asked to select an OS to boot. <br>
<img class="[diskimg]" src="http://bhrigu123.github.io//images/ubuntu/ubuntuboot.jpg" width="500"> <br>
The first option will launch Ubuntu.
The last <em>Windows loader</em> option will launch you Windows, like it used to before.</p>

<p>So I hope this tutorial was helpful to you, and you could install Ubuntu without any trouble. <br>
Comment here if you still have any doubts or problems, or for your feedback.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So after setting up octopress and learning how to use it and deploy using Github, I have finally set out to blogging, which I wanted to start for a long time but was everytime too lazy to set up my computer.</p>

<p>Now, for a novice like me, this blogging technique is much different from the regular blogging websites, like Wordpress, since you have to work <!--more--> using the terminal (shell) of your system, and to be honest, it is much more fun this way. It gives you more of a hacker&rsquo;s feel as you have to do a lot of shell scripting. Moreover, markdown language makes writing posts easier as well as interesting.<br>
I&rsquo;m looking forward to explore the functionalities this blogging service can provide, and experiment with the third party plugins to get more features.</p>

<p>One more reason I couldn&rsquo;t start a blog earlier was that I wasn&rsquo;t sure about the content I would put in it. Now that I&rsquo;ve started competitive programming and some web development, I would post about problem solving skills and algorithms (as I learn along), personal experiences, and also anything that is worth sharing and I find could be of service to you.</p>

<p>Comments and feedbacks are always welcome, and I am also keen to follow more blogs, so get in touch.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
