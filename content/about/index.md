Hey! I am Bhrigu Srivastava.

I am a software engineer and I did my bachelors from Delhi Technological University (batch of 2017).

I love developing apps and softwares. I also love problem solving and algorithmic puzzles. I have developed production websites and apps serving customers for their needs. More on them on my [Projects](/projects) page.

I have a constant hunger for learning new things, be it in anything - software development, music, writing, speaking, content creating, sports, reading, etc.


You can reach out to me via email captain.bhrigu@gmail.com , and can also connect with me on Twitter / FB (links in footer).

That's all for now. Will work on revamping my *About* page to add more stuff.
