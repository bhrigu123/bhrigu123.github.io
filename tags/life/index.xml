      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking back at 2020, it was a confusing ride. The pandemic / lockdown had nothing to with that, for me at least. For me it was&amp;hellip;.really&amp;hellip;confusing, at a personal level. Not sure what other word to use to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the March of 2020 now. I am super late this time to write about my last year in review blog post. The thing is, 2020 has been a super confusing ride from the beginning. And it&amp;rsquo;s just March.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, 2018 is over and it feels like it went by so fast. As compared to 2017 or &amp;lsquo;16, there might not be anything that was majorly interesting, but nonetheless, it was a good year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh, hey! Don&amp;rsquo;t mind, this is just a test blog. I don&amp;rsquo;t really have anything on my mind on what to put down on this one. I overslept the last night, had some relaxing nap some time later, and here I am super awake at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2016 is almost over and I felt like writing again (which happens quite rarely). Trying to recollect few of the highilghts of this year, which was full of surprises, excitement and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
