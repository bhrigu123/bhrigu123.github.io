Looking back at 2020, it was a confusing ride. The pandemic / lockdown had nothing to with that, for me at least. For me it was....really...confusing, at a personal level. Not sure what other word to use to describe it.

It had started off well, in January. But Feb / March onwards was when it started to get...confusing.

Anyways, leaving that confusion apart, due to the lockdown I really got to try out things I didn't take out time to do earlier. I learnt cooking, more drums, keyboard, more guitar, got myself into reading again, and started to take gym seriously.

I also got a chance to learn motorcycle and also mastered my driving. I got more active on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqgqCOWlxpYDPH5whE6mb3Q) and made videos related to music and tech. I revamped my blog and got more into writing. I kick started learning Flutter and also NextJS. 

Unlike my other 'Year in review' blog posts, I'm not really in the feeling to write more about it.

Going forward, I hope I continue to actively:
* Read
* Write
* Develop apps
* Learn
* Explore and Take risks
* Exercise and play sports

That's all for that. Happy New Year :)
