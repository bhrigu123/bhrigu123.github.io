> here it goes!

<div align="center">
	She's like no one you've met before,<br>
	She makes trouble and she wants it more.<br>
	A perfect blend of innocence and mischief,<br>
	Her voice is something you can't resist.<br><br>
	Being in her presence is like an addictive drug,<br>
	and when she's not around, the whole world's a little dull.<br><br>
	She smells like heaven;<br>
	Her hair makes an arrangement of sinusoidal waves,<br>
	and when they're open, they light up her face.<br><br>
	And when she laughs,<br>
	She squints her eyes in the most wonderful way,<br>
	that'll make you fall in love with her all over again.<br><br><br>
